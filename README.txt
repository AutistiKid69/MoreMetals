Hello and thank you for choosing More Metals!

Currently, there are two new metals you can obtain in-game.

Using these two metals, you can make new tools that are better than the usual copper/tin tools
without even needing to mine ores! All you need is a LOT of stone, a LOT of dirt and wood, and some patience.
